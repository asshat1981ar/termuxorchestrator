Validate output with schema when requested.\n - src/agents/claude.js: similar wrapper for claude-code CLI. Provide an option `--format=json` in the CLI call if available.\n - src/agents/continue.js and src/agents/sweAgent.js with standardized interfaces.\n - src/schema/appspec.schema.json: strict JSON Schema that requires name, platform, framework, pages (array), features (array), data (array). Use AJV schema.\n - src/agents/index.js: high-level functions:\n    - createAppSpec(nlDescription) -> calls runGemini with a system prompt (include the schema) and returns JSON validated against schema.\n    - scaffoldFromAppSpec(appspec, framework) -> calls claude wrapper to scaffold files (returns path to scaffolded project).\n    - implementFeature(featureSpec) -> uses continue wrapper to create feature branch, code, tests.\n    - autoFix(projectPath) -> runs swe-agent wrapper and returns list of fixes applied.\n - tests/agents.test.js: small unit tests mocking CLI outputs (no network calls).\n - README.md: how to configure API keys, environment variables, and run tests.\n\nRequirements:\n - Each wrapper must log (level, timestamp) and write to logs/agents.log.\n - Avoid synchronous `execSync` blocking the event loop; use async processes.\n - Provide example usage of createAppSpec with a sample NL description.\n - If a CLI binary is missing, the wrapper should produce a helpful error message suggesting the Termux package or npm package name.\n\nReturn all files with contents.

Each generator must be deterministic and produce small, testable components suitable for running in CI.\n\nUSER: Create repo termux-orchestrator-features with:\n - package.json with dependencies: execa, simple-git, ajv.\n - feature-generators/generateFeature.js:\n    - CLI: node generateFeature.js --appdir ./out/RecipeSnap --feature camera --framework rn\n    - It should accept feature spec JSON and call the claude wrapper (src/agents/claude.js in the agents project) to produce files, then write them into the appdir, create branch `feat/<feature>`, commit, and output a JSON manifest of files created.\n - generators for features:\n    - camera (RN): Screen component, use expo-camera, basic final image save to sqlite images table.\n    - sqlite (RN): helper using `expo-sqlite` stub and tests.\n    - dark_mode: theme provider and toggle.\n - tests/run_feature_tests.sh: for RN uses `npm test` (jest stub), for flutter uses `flutter test`.\n\nRequirements:\n - Each generated file must come with a unit test stub (jest for RN).\n - The generator should NOT use external internet except via claude wrapper already configured.\n - Add README describing how to call generators.\n\nReturn full contents and example output when generating the camera feature into a RN project (list of files written).\n\nRun-after-generation\n\nnode feature-generators/generateFeature.js --appdir ./out/RecipeSnap --feature camera --framework rn\nbash tests/run_feature_tests.sh ./out/RecipeSnap\n\n\n---\n\n5) Tests, Lint & Auto-fix (SWE-agent integration)\n\nPurpose: ensure generated code is testable, linted, and run through SWE-agent to auto-fix issues before CI.\n\nWhat to produce\n\nquality/ with:\n\nlint-configs for JS (eslint) and Kotlin (ktlint notes)\n\nquality/run_quality_pipeline.sh that runs lint → tests → swe-agent auto fix → retest\n\nHooks for pre-commit using husky (RN) (optional)\n\nswe-integration wrapper that calls swe-agent and outputs a JSON patch list\n\n\n\nPrompt for Claude-Code (Tests & Lint)\n\nSYSTEM: You are claude-code: a test & quality engineer. Produce a quality pipeline that runs linter, unit tests, and then invokes swe-agent to auto-fix failing tests or lint errors. Work for a mixed repo (RN + flutter + compose) and keep scripts defensive and idempotent.\n\nUSER: Create repo termux-orchestrator-quality with:\n - quality/run_quality_pipeline.sh\n    - args: path to project\n    - runs: eslint (if package.json present), npm test, flutter test (if flutter project), gradle test (if compose)\n    - if tests/lint fail, call swe-agent wrapper (from agents) to auto-fix, apply patches, and re-run tests.\n - swe-integration/swe_wrapper.js: uses agents/swe-agent wrapper, returns patch list and applies patches to git (create branch swe/auto-fix/<timestamp>).\n - Add docs on how to run the pipeline in Termux, and recommended thresholds for auto-fix (e.g., only apply fixes if swe-agent produces < 300 LOC changes).\n\nAcceptance:\n - Pipeline exits 0 only if tests pass.\n - A report (quality/report-<timestamp>.json) is written with results and swe-agent actions.\n\nReturn scripts and sample output when tests pass and when tests initially fail and are auto-fixed.\n\nRun-after-generation\n\nbash quality/run_quality_pipeline.sh ./out/RecipeSnap\n\n\n---\n\n6) CI/CD configs & API triggers\n\nPurpose: generate CI config templates and small scripts to call CI APIs (EAS, Codemagic, GitHub Actions). Provide polling and artifact-download scripts.\n\nWhat to generate\n\n.github/workflows/android-build.yml — a GitHub Actions workflow for Compose + general build that can be triggered by API.\n\ncodemagic.yaml — Codemagic configuration for Flutter (minimal).\n\neas.json — profile for EAS builds.\n\nci/trigger_ci.js — Node script that triggers builds via API and polls status; accepts --ci eas|codemagic|github and --repo <repo_url>\n\nci/download_artifact.js — download artifact and write to artifacts/\n\n\nPrompt for Claude-Code (CI/CD)\n\nSYSTEM: You are claude-code, a CI/CDevops author. Produce build pipeline templates and small API-triggering scripts to start and poll builds for EAS, Codemagic, and GitHub Actions. Target offline-capable Termux developer: scripts must accept env tokens and use standard REST APIs.\n\nUSER: Create repo termux-orchestrator-ci with:\n - .github/workflows/android-build.yml (a reusable workflow that:\n    - checks out repo\n    - sets up JDK, node, flutter (conditional)\n    - for RN runs `eas build --platform android --non-interactive` (but also include a fallback Gradle path)\n    - uploads artifact as workflow artifact)\n - codemagic.yaml for Flutter builds with an example for Android APK\n - eas.json for Expo with a production profile (without secrets)\n - ci/trigger_ci.js:\n    - usage: node trigger_ci.js --ci github --repo owner/repo --branch main\n    - for github: call the actions/workflows/dispatches API to kick the workflow, then poll `runs` for completion and return the artifact URL.\n    - for codemagic & eas: use their respective public APIs to trigger and poll builds.\n - ci/download_artifact.js: given artifact URL, download to artifacts/ and set file perms.\n\nRequirements:\n - All scripts read tokens from environment variables and fail clearly if missing.\n - Each workflow and YAML includes comments where user must add secrets.\n - Provide example API calls in README and expected JSON responses.\n\nReturn all files and a sample run flow using a fake repo (explain what lines to edit with tokens).\n\nRun-after-generation\n\nexport GITHUB_TOKEN=...\nnode ci/trigger_ci.js --ci github --repo myuser/recipesnap --branch main\nnode ci/download_artifact.js --url \"<artifact_url>\"\n\n\n---\n\n7) Delivery Layer — Termux download, notify, install\n\nPurpose: Termux scripts to poll CI, download APK, notify user, optionally auto-install via adb or termux-open.\n\nWhat to generate\n\ndelivery/poll_and_deliver.sh — orchestrator-side script that polls CI API until artifact ready, downloads it, runs termux-notification, and (optionally) termux-open to launch installer.\n\ndelivery/auto_install.sh — uses adb (if developer enables adb in phone) to sideload.\n\n\nPrompt for Claude-Code (Delivery)\n\nSYSTEM: You are claude-code: a mobile delivery engineer. Create Termux-friendly delivery scripts that poll CI endpoints, download APK artifacts, and present them to the user using termux-api.\n\nUSER: Create repo termux-orchestrator-delivery with:\n - delivery/poll_and_deliver.sh\n   - usage: poll_and_deliver.sh --ci github --run-id 12345 --out ./artifacts\n   - polls until artifact is available, downloads to specified folder, sends termux-notification with \"Install\" deep link.\n   - supports parameter --auto-install to call termux-open or adb install if enabled.\n - delivery/auto_install.sh\n   - if `adb` is present and device is authorized, run `adb install -r <apk>`.\n - README with instructions: how to enable Termux:API, how to accept installs.\n - Ensure downloaded files have 0644 perms.\n\nReturn scripts and sample output showing notification text and file path.\n\nRun-after-generation\n\nbash delivery/poll_and_deliver.sh --ci github --run-id 12345 --out ./artifacts --auto-install\n\n\n---\n\n8) Orchestrator CLI — the glue that ties everything together\n\nPurpose: Node.js CLI orchestrator that accepts a natural language description, creates AppSpec (via Gemini), scaffolds project, runs feature loop, pushes to GitHub, triggers CI, polls build, and delivers APK — exposes flags to choose framework and to run in dry-run mode.\n\nWhat to generate\n\norchestrator/ Node CLI:\n\nbin/orchestrator.js (executable)\n\nsrc/index.js — orchestrator workflow implementing Step 1..5 using agent wrappers and scaffolders\n\nconfig/default.yml — default timeouts, polling intervals, CI provider preference\n\norchestrator.sh — thin bash wrapper for Termux aliases\n\nREADME.md with full CLI usage examples and recommended env variables\n\n\nImportant behaviors:\n\nUse a transactional approach: create a working dir, perform actions, if any step fails, create a rollback/ folder with logs and git patch for inspection.\n\nDry-run mode prints the commands the orchestrator would run and writes ./dry-run-manifest.json.\n\nUser confirmation step before pushing to remote (with --yes flag to skip).\n\nExpose a --fast mode that just scaffold + local start (no CI).\n\n\n\nPrompt for Claude-Code (Orchestrator CLI)\n\nSYSTEM: You are claude-code, an SRE-level Node.js engineer. Create a robust orchestrator CLI that ties together the agents and scaffolders already generated. Focus on clear logging, transactional behavior, and safety (do not push secrets to logs). Use async/await, execa, simple-git. Output code for a Node.js CLI project.\n\nUSER: Create repo termux-orchestrator with:\n - package.json with bin \"orchestrator\"\n - bin/orchestrator.js: a small executable that parses args (commander) and calls src/index.js\n - src/index.js: implements the workflow:\n    1) call agents.createAppSpec(nlDescription)\n    2) choose scaffold script using framework preference\n    3) call feature-generators to implement features in parallel (respect concurrency limit)\n    4) run quality pipeline\n    5) commit and optionally push (prompt unless --yes)\n    6) trigger CI via ci/trigger_ci.js and poll\n    7) call delivery/poll_and_deliver.sh to fetch artifact and notify\n - src/utils/transaction.js: helper to record steps and allow easy rollback (create revert patch)\n - config/default.yml: timeouts and concurrency settings\n - README: usage examples and required env variables\n\nAcceptance:\n - provide an example run with `orchestrator \"Build me a recipe app with camera and sqlite\" --framework rn --yes --fast`\n - make sure"
